# Shopping Cart App

Our Shopping Cart app from last week utilized the **Context API** to manage data and functions effectively.

## What's Next?

### ðŸš€ Let's Add `useReducer`!

- Replace the functions you previously created to update the shopping cart.
- Introduce a **reducer** and a **dispatch** to manage the cart updates more efficiently.

This enhancement will make the application more robust and scalable by centralizing state logic. Get ready to streamline your cart's state management with `useReducer`!
